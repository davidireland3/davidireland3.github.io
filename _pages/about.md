I am a PhD student at the University of Warwick. My research interests include all things Reinforcement Learning, with my particular focus being on applications where the state can be represented as a graph, such as Combinatorial Optimisation. Owing to this, I am also interested in advances in Geometric Deep Learning. My supervisor is [Professor Giovanni Montana]([url](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/montana/)) of the Statistics Department at the University of Warwick.
