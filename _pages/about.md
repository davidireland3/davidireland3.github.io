I am a PhD student at the University of Warwick. My research interests include all things Reinforcement Learning, with my particular focus being on applications where the state can be represented as a graph, such as Combinatorial Optimisation. Owing to this, I am also interested in advances in Geometric Deep Learning. My supervisor is [Professor Giovanni Montana]([url](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/montana/)) of the Statistics Department at the University of Warwick. 

Previously I was at the University of Lancaster where I completed a BSc in Mathematics and an MSc in Statistics. My MSc thesis was titled "Multi-armed bandits and their uses in clinical trials".


## Interests
I love to go on walks, especially in the Lake District when I am back home and can take my little dog along. I also enjoy reading, particularly science fiction/fantasy; some of my favourite books include the A Song of Ice and Fire series by G.R.R.M (I've been waiting for Winds of Winter for more than a decade now!), the first Dune trilogy by Frank Herbert (in particular, the first book is possibly the best I've ever read), and some of Philip K. Dick's books, in particular A Scanner Darkly and Ubik. I also try to travel as often as possible, with my favourite place I've visited so far being Florence. 

## News
* My first paper, [LeNSE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10106.pdf), was accepted to [ICML 2022](https://icml.cc)! Come along and see the poster if you're attending in person, or the virtual slides if you're attending virtually.
