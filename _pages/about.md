I am a PhD student at the University of Warwick under the supervision of [Professor Giovanni Montana]([url](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/montana/)) of the Statistics Department at the University of Warwick. My research interests include all things reinforcement learning (RL), with my particular focus during my PhD being on problems where the state and/or action space have some combinatorial aspect to them. My first paper, published at ICML, looked at using RL to help solve combinatorial optimisation problems. We used RL to help existing heuristic solvers scale up to solve problems on graphs with millions of nodes/edges. More recently, I have been interested in works with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. This work ties closely with multi-agent RL, which I am also interested in.

Previously I was at the University of Lancaster where I completed a BSc in Mathematics and an MSc in Statistics. My MSc thesis was titled "Multi-armed bandits and their uses in clinical trials".

* I was invited to deliver some labs at the University of Salerno's First Doctoral Summer School in Data Science -- content will be made public in due course. 
* As of September 2022 I'll be joining MediaTek Research as a research intern, working on Hierarchical RL - in particular, the options framework.  
* My first paper, [LeNSE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10106.pdf), was accepted to [ICML 2022](https://icml.cc)! Come along and see the poster if you're attending in person, or the virtual slides if you're attending virtually.
